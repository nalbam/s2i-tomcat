This is an S2I tomcat-8.5.31 running with java-8 compiling with maven-3.5.3 centos base image responsible for consuming a java maven tomcat project
and deploying it onto Apache-Tomcat application server.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build git://github.com/bespin-sbl/sample-tomcat bespinsbl/s2i-tomcat:8.5-jdk-8 sample-tomcat

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 sample-tomcat

Details:
If a pom.xml is present in the source directory, the project is built with maven and the
output war file defined with WAR_NAME will be copied into the Tomcat webapps directory.

You can specify the path to the pom.xml file to build into your git repo with POM_PATH. (default set to .)

If there is no pom.xml, but the war specified with WAR_NAME is found, it will be moved to tomcat webapps directory.

The default Maven build arguments can be overridden by setting MAVEN_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
default MAVEN_ARGS=clean install -DskipTests.
The default Maven build arguments can be appended by setting MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND.
